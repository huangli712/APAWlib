# HPAW

The HPAW project provides some projector augmented wave datasets. These datasets are mainly designed for the actinides. They were generated by using the [**Atompaw**](http://users.wfu.edu/natalie/papers/pwpaw/man.html) code. You can use them along with the [**Abinit**](https://www.abinit.org) and [**Quantum Espresso**](http://www.quantum-espresso.org) codes.
